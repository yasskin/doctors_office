Doctor's Office
This program is for office administrators to track patients in a doctor's office. Look through the user stories and design a database schema for your application. Here are some users stories to get started:

As an administrator, I want to add a doctor to the database with a name and specialty.
As an administrator, I want to add a patient with their name and birthdate.
As an administrator, I want to be able to assign a patient to a doctor for care. (Hint: Doctors will have a one-to-many relationship with their patients.)
As a doctor, I want to see the list of patients that have been assigned to me.
Now the doctor's office has been grown to include many doctors with the same specialty. The doctors have organized themselves into specialty groups. So when an administrator wants to enter a doctor, they must first select a specialty group and then add a doctor.

As a patient, I want to see a list of all the doctors in a particular specialty. A doctor will only have one specialty. (Hint: change from storing specialty as a column to making a specialties table.)
As an administrator, I want to view an alphabetical list of doctors including the number of patients they see. (Hint: Do some online research for SQL ORDERing and COUNTing.)
